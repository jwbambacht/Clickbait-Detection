# Clickbait-Detection

## PART 1:
* Read data
* Feature extraction
* Come up with new features (based on NLP theory)

## PART 2:
* Train classifier(s) (which classifier is best and why)
* Explain potential overfitting
* Explain potential bias
* How do we deal with bias and overfitting?
* Cross-validation why (not)?
## PART 3:
* Evaluate results
* Which metrics are (not) useful?
* Which conclusions can we (not) make?
* Maybe give some further recommendations on how to improve? (Like more data, different ML techniques etc.)
